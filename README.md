# Strategies and effects of Foreigner Talk. A multimodal analysis
I uploaded a working paper to Leuven Working Papers in Linguistics (https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/workingpapers): Foreigner Directed Gesture: larger, faster longer (Valentijn Prov√©, Bert Oben and Julien Perrez). The script that was used to conduct the analysis for this paper can be found here as a webpage: https://provevalentijn.github.io/foreigner_talk_gesture/
